# Drilling Technique - Where Sharp Tools Meet Metal

Good technique separates the professionals from the amateurs. Having the right 
tools is only the beginning - knowing how to use them effectively makes all 
the difference. This chapter covers the practical techniques that will help 
you drill clean, accurate holes consistently.

## Setup Checklist

Before you pull that handle:

1. **Work secured** - No exceptions
2. **Speed set** - Check the chart
3. **Fluid applied** - Don't run dry
4. **Safety gear** - Eyes especially
5. **Clear area** - No loose items

## The Approach

### Starting the hole

1. Bring drill to work slowly
2. Let center punch guide it
3. Light pressure to start
4. Feel it center up
5. Increase pressure smoothly

**Common mistake**: Slamming into the work. Let the drill find center.

## Pilot Holes - The Professional Approach

A pilot hole is a small-diameter hole drilled as a guide for larger holes or
fasteners. Think of it as creating a precise starting point that eliminates
drill wandering and reduces the cutting forces required for the final hole
size. This technique is fundamental to achieving accurate, clean holes in
metal fabrication.

### What Pilot Holes Are and Their Purpose

Pilot holes serve multiple critical functions in metalworking. They provide
a centering guide that prevents larger drill bits from walking across the
surface, especially on curved or angled surfaces. They also reduce the web
thickness that the final drill must cut through, significantly decreasing
the torque and thrust forces required. This reduction in cutting forces
translates to longer tool life, better surface finish, and more accurate
hole placement.

The pilot hole also creates a stress concentration that helps the main drill
bit start cutting immediately rather than deforming material. This is
particularly important in work-hardening materials like stainless steel,
where any rubbing without cutting can create hardened zones that destroy
drill bits.

### When to Use Pilot Holes

Use pilot holes whenever drilling holes larger than 1/4 inch in metal,
especially in materials over 1/8 inch thick. They are essential when:

- Drilling hardened materials like stainless steel or tool steel
- Working with thin sheet metal where breakthrough might cause distortion
- Creating holes in round stock or angled surfaces where drill walking is
  likely
- Using portable drills where control is more difficult than on a drill press
- Drilling large holes (over 1/2 inch) in any material
- Working with materials that work harden, such as stainless steel or
  inconel

In aluminum and mild steel, pilot holes become less critical for smaller
holes but still improve accuracy and surface finish. For hardened steel
or cast iron, pilot holes are nearly mandatory for any hole larger than
the drill's web thickness.

### Determining Correct Pilot Hole Size

The optimal pilot hole size depends on the material and final hole diameter.
For most applications, use these guidelines:

**Standard Rule**: Pilot hole diameter should equal the web thickness of the
final drill bit. Web thickness typically measures 10-15% of the drill
diameter for standard twist drills.

**Quick Pilot Hole Sizing**:

| Final Hole Size | Pilot Hole Size        |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1/4" to 1/2"    | 1/8"                   |
| 1/2" to 3/4"    | 3/16"                  |
| 3/4" to 1"      | 1/4"                   |
| Over 1"         | ~25% of final diameter |

**Material Considerations**:
- Soft materials (aluminum): Can use slightly larger pilots
- Hard materials (stainless): Use smaller pilots to maintain drill control
- Thin sheet (under 1/8"): Pilot should be 50% of material thickness

### Step-by-Step Pilot Hole Technique

**Step 1: Layout and Center Punch**
Mark your hole location precisely and create a center punch dimple. The
punch should be deep enough to capture the pilot drill tip but not so
deep as to cause stress concentrations in the finished part.

**Step 2: Drill the Pilot Hole**
Use a 135-degree split-point drill bit for the pilot hole. These bits
self-center better and cut more aggressively at the tip. Set your drill
press to approximately 1.5x the speed you would use for the final hole
size in the same material. Apply steady, moderate pressure - enough to
produce continuous chips but not so much that the drill flexes.

**Step 3: Check Pilot Hole Quality**
The pilot hole should be round, properly sized, and free of burrs. Any
wandering in the pilot hole will be magnified in the final hole. If the
pilot hole position is incorrect, it's better to fill it with weld and
start over than to attempt correction with the final drill.

**Step 4: Drill to Final Size**
Switch to your final size drill bit. For best results, use a 118-degree
point drill for the final pass, as the longer cutting edges remove
material more efficiently when guided by the pilot hole. The 135-degree
bit did its job of starting accurately; now the 118-degree bit can
optimize material removal.

Run the final drill at normal speeds for the hole size and material.
The pilot hole eliminates the need for the drill to cut through the web,
so cutting forces are significantly reduced. Feed pressure should be
steady and moderate - the pilot hole guides the drill, so excessive
force is unnecessary and can cause problems.

## Pro Tips from the Field

### The Sound Tell

Experienced operators drill by ear:
- Pitch changes = problem
- Steady sound = good cut
- Learn your machine's song

### The One-Shot Rule

Try to drill in one pass when possible:
- Better finish
- Less work hardening
- Faster overall
- Less wear

### The 90% Rule

At 90% through, ease up:
- Prevents grab
- Cleaner exit
- Saves drills
- Safer

### Breaking Through

When you're almost through the material:
1. Feel for reduced resistance
2. Back off pressure
3. Let drill finish naturally
4. Don't force the last bit

This prevents:
- Drill bit grabbing
- Material tearing
- Poor hole finish
- Broken drills

## De-burring - The Professional Finish

After drilling any hole, burrs need removal. The easiest method I have found
uses a countersink in a cordless drill. Keep one handy by your machine. Even
when not visible, I consider it good craftsmanship to always de-burr and add a
slight chamfer to holes. This provides a clean look and prevents cuts.

### Countersink Method

My favorite for most work:

**Process**:
1. Countersink in cordless drill
2. Light pressure
3. Just break the edge
4. Both sides of hole
5. Consistent chamfer

**Results**:
- Clean appearance
- No sharp edges
- Professional look
- Prevents cuts

### Deburring Knife

A de-burring knife also works and belongs in every metal working shop. While
effective at removing burrs, it does not achieve quite the same finish as a
countersink, though it works especially well on aluminum.

**Technique**:
1. Angle blade to edge
2. Rotate around hole
3. Light pressure
4. Remove burr only
5. Don't enlarge hole
