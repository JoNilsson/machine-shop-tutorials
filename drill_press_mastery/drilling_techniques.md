# Drilling Techniques

The actual drilling part - where sharp tools meet metal and things either go right or very wrong.

## Basic Drilling Process

### Setup Checklist

Before you pull that handle:

1. **Work secured** - No exceptions
2. **Speed set** - Check the chart
3. **Fluid applied** - Don't run dry
4. **Safety gear** - Eyes especially
5. **Clear area** - No loose items

### The Approach

**Starting the hole**:
1. Bring drill to work slowly
2. Let center punch guide it
3. Light pressure to start
4. Feel it center up
5. Increase pressure smoothly

**Common mistake**: Slamming into the work. Let the drill find center.

## Reading the Cut

Your senses tell you everything:

### Sound

**Good sounds**:
- Steady cutting noise
- Consistent pitch
- No squealing
- No hammering

**Bad sounds**:
- High-pitched squeal = too fast/no lube
- Chatter = something loose
- Grinding = dull drill
- Silence = not cutting (rubbing)

### Feel

**Good feel**:
- Steady resistance
- Smooth feed
- Chips evacuating
- No grabbing

**Bad feel**:
- Pulsing/hammering
- Excessive force needed
- Sudden grab
- No progress

### Look

**Watch for**:
- Chip color and shape
- Smoke (bad!)
- Drill wandering
- Coolant flow

## Chip Management

### What Good Chips Tell You

**Steel chips**:
- 6's and 9's = perfect
- Slight blue tinge = OK
- Consistent size = good feed
- Breaking naturally = right speed

**Aluminum chips**:
- Tight spirals
- Shiny, not burned
- May need clearing
- Watch for welding

**Stainless chips**:
- Tighter curls than steel
- Must keep moving
- No color change
- Continuous OK

### Clearing Chips

**When to clear**:
- Flutes packing
- Every 1/2" in deep holes
- Change in sound
- Increased resistance

**How to clear**:
1. Retract fully
2. Brush or blow clear
3. Add fresh fluid
4. Continue drilling

**Never**: Try to clear while spinning!

## Special Techniques

### Peck Drilling

For holes deeper than 3x diameter:

**Process**:
1. Drill 1/2 diameter
2. Retract completely
3. Clear chips
4. Re-enter carefully
5. Repeat, increasing depth

**Why it works**:
- Clears chips
- Cools drill
- Reduces breakage
- Better finish

### Pilot Holes

For large holes (over 1/2"):

**Standard method**:
1. Pilot at 1/3 final size
2. Maybe step drill intermediate
3. Final size
4. Better accuracy
5. Less stress on machine

**Example**: 1" final hole
- 1/4" pilot
- 5/8" intermediate (optional)
- 1" final

### Breaking Through

The danger zone:

**Thin material**:
- Reduce pressure near breakthrough
- Expect grab
- Hold firmly
- Back material when possible

**Thick material**:
- Maintain steady feed
- Don't stop at breakthrough
- Clear completely
- Watch for exit burr

### Interrupted Cuts

Drilling through welds, keyways, etc:

**Adjustments**:
- Reduce speed 25%
- Steady pressure
- Expect roughness
- Shorter drill life
- More frequent clearing

## Common Problems and Fixes

### Drill Walking

Despite center punch:

**Causes**:
- Dull drill
- Too high RPM
- Poor punch mark
- Uneven surface

**Fixes**:
- Deeper center punch
- Start slower
- Spot with center drill
- File surface flat

### Overheating

Everything's getting hot:

**Signs**:
- Smoke
- Blue chips
- Drill discoloration
- Burning smell

**Fixes**:
- More coolant
- Reduce RPM
- Clear chips more
- Check drill sharpness

### Poor Hole Quality

Rough, oversize, or tapered:

**Causes**:
- Dull drill
- Wrong speed
- Runout
- Poor setup

**Fixes**:
- Sharp drill
- Correct speed/feed
- Check spindle
- Rigid setup

### Breaking Drills

Expensive and dangerous:

**Causes**:
- Too much feed pressure
- Packed chips
- Grabbing on exit
- Side loading

**Prevention**:
- Steady pressure
- Clear chips often
- Reduce feed at exit
- Keep drill straight

## Deburring - Don't Skip It

The job's not done until it's deburred:

### Countersink Method

My favorite for most work:

**Process**:
1. Countersink in cordless drill
2. Light pressure
3. Just break the edge
4. Both sides of hole
5. Consistent chamfer

**Results**:
- Clean appearance
- No sharp edges
- Professional look
- Prevents cuts

### Deburring Knife

For tighter spots:

**Technique**:
1. Angle blade to edge
2. Rotate around hole
3. Light pressure
4. Remove burr only
5. Don't enlarge hole

### File Method

Old school but works:

**When to use**:
- Large holes
- Heavy burrs
- No other tools
- Production work

## Material-Specific Tips

### Aluminum

**Challenges**:
- Chip welding
- Built-up edge
- Grabbing

**Solutions**:
- Higher speed
- Frequent clearing
- Lots of coolant
- Polished drills

### Stainless Steel

**Challenges**:
- Work hardening
- Heat buildup
- Tool wear

**Solutions**:
- Constant feed
- Never stop cutting
- Cobalt drills
- Sulfur-based coolant

### Cast Iron

**Different animal**:
- No coolant (dry cut)
- Powdery chips
- Abrasive
- Dirty

**Techniques**:
- Higher speed OK
- Steady feed
- Clear chips with air
- Wear mask

### Plastics

**Issues**:
- Melting
- Grabbing
- Chip wrap

**Fixes**:
- Very high speed
- Light feed
- Specialized drills
- Air cooling

## Pro Tips

### The Sound Tell

Experienced operators drill by ear:
- Pitch changes = problem
- Steady sound = good cut
- Learn your machine's song

### The One-Shot Rule

Try to drill in one pass when possible:
- Better finish
- Less work hardening
- Faster overall
- Less wear

### The 90% Rule

At 90% through, ease up:
- Prevents grab
- Cleaner exit
- Saves drills
- Safer

### The Chip Color Guide

For steel:
- Silver = too slow
- Straw = perfect
- Blue = acceptable
- Purple/black = too fast

## Safety Reminders

Because it bears repeating:

1. **Secure work** - Always
2. **Eye protection** - No exceptions
3. **No gloves** - They catch
4. **Clear chips** - When stopped
5. **Stay alert** - Things happen fast

## The Bottom Line

Good drilling is about feel as much as numbers. Start with the right speed, listen to the cut, watch your chips, and adjust as needed. 

Every material cuts differently. Every drill press has its own personality. The more you drill, the better you'll get at reading the signs.

Remember: It's not a race. A steady, controlled hole beats a fast, sloppy one every time.
