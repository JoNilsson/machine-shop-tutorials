# Drill Press Mastery

How to drill holes that are actually round, in the right place, and don't turn your workpiece into a spinning weapon.

## Tutorials

1. [Drill Bit Selection](./drill_bit_selection.md) - Understanding twist drills, point angles, and materials
2. [Layout and Marking](./layout_and_marking.md) - Getting your holes in the right place every time
3. [Work Holding](./work_holding.md) - Keeping parts from becoming projectiles
4. [Speeds and Feeds](./speeds_and_feeds.md) - Simple rules that actually work
5. [Drilling Techniques](./drilling_techniques.md) - Making clean holes and reading your chips

## Why This Matters

Drilling holes seems simple enough, but there's a difference between punching a hole and drilling a proper hole. Get it wrong and you'll:

- Break drills (expensive)
- Make oval holes (embarrassing)
- Launch parts across the shop (dangerous)
- Burn up your bits in stainless (frustrating)

These tutorials come from real shop experience - what actually works when you need to get parts done.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should:

- Know basic shop safety
- Be able to read a ruler
- Understand RPM (revolutions per minute)

If you're completely new to metalworking, start with the [fundamental skills](../fundamental_skills/README.md) section first.

## The Golden Rule of Drilling

**Never hold work by hand**. That innocent piece of aluminum becomes a spinning knife when the drill grabs. Use proper work holding - your fingers will thank you.
