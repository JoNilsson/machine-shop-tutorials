# Speeds and Feeds for Drilling

Forget the complicated charts and formulas. Here's a simple system that actually works in the real world.

## The Simple Formula You'll Actually Use

### My Baseline Rule

**700 RPM for a 1/2" hole in mild steel**

That's it. That's your starting point. Now adjust from there.

### Adjusting for Hole Size

Smaller hole = faster speed (cutting edges travel less per revolution)

**Quick math**:

| Hole Size | RPM  | Multiplier    |
| --------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 1"        | 350  | 0.5x          |
| 1/2"      | 700  | 1x (baseline) |
| 1/4"      | 1400 | 2x            |
| 1/8"      | 2800 | 4x            |

**The pattern**: Double the RPM when you halve the diameter.

### Adjusting for Material

**Softer = Faster**:

- Aluminum: 2x the steel speed
- Brass: 2x the steel speed
- Plastic: 3-4x the steel speed

**Harder = Slower**:

- Stainless: 1/2 the steel speed
- Cast iron: Same as steel (maybe slower)
- Tool steel: 1/3 the steel speed

## Real World Examples

Let's work through some actual setups:

### Example 1: 1/4" Hole in Aluminum

1. Start: 700 RPM (1/2" in steel)
2. Adjust for size: 1400 RPM (1/4" is half of 1/2")
3. Adjust for material: 2800 RPM (aluminum = 2x)
4. Set drill press near 2800 RPM

### Example 2: 3/8" Hole in Stainless

1. Start: 700 RPM (1/2" in steel)
2. Adjust for size: ~930 RPM (3/8" is 3/4 of 1/2")
3. Adjust for material: ~465 RPM (stainless = 1/2)
4. Set drill press around 450-500 RPM

### Example 3: 1" Hole in Mild Steel

1. Start: 700 RPM (1/2" in steel)
2. Adjust for size: 350 RPM (1" is 2x of 1/2")
3. No material adjustment (it's steel)
4. Set drill press to 350 RPM

## Reading Your Chips

The chips tell you everything:

### Good Chips

**Mild steel**:

- Curled like 6's or 9's
- Blue/gold color is OK
- Break into manageable pieces
- Some spring shapes OK

**Aluminum**:

- Tight curls
- May wrap on drill
- Shiny, not discolored
- Clear flutes frequently

**Stainless**:

- Tighter curls
- Consistent thickness
- No discoloration
- Continuous is OK

### Bad Chips - Adjust

**Too fast (RPM)**:

- Chips are dust
- Blue/purple color
- Burning smell
- Drill gets hot fast

**Too slow (RPM)**:

- Long stringy chips
- Rough hole walls
- Excessive force needed
- Chattering sound

**Too fast (feed)**:

- Thick chips
- Drill stalls
- Breaking drills
- Rough breakthrough

**Too slow (feed)**:

- Thin wisps
- Work hardening
- Squealing
- No chips (rubbing)

## Feed Pressure

No numbers here - it's all in the feel!
Best tip is to _let the drill bit do the work!_
You want to cut the hole with the lest amount of pressure possible.

### The Right Pressure

- Steady chip flow
- Drill advances smoothly
- No forcing required
- Can maintain by hand

### Too Much Pressure

- Drill stalls
- Motor bogs down
- Chips pack in flutes
- Drills break

### Too Little Pressure

- Drill rubs (not cutting)
- Work hardens
- Drill dulls quickly
- Excessive heat (smoke is bad)

## Cutting Fluid

Not optional for good results:

### Types and When

**Water-based** (like Anchor Lube):

- Stays in place
- Doesn't smoke
- Easy cleanup
- My current favorite

**Cutting oil**:

- Better for tough materials
- Smokes more
- Messier
- Traditional choice

**WD-40**:

- Emergency only
- Better than nothing
- Not a real cutting fluid
- Aluminum only
- You should be using Kroil anyways!

### Application

**Drill press**:

1. Apply before starting
2. Add more every few seconds
3. Flood for deep holes
4. Brush on is fine

**Key**: Keep it wet. Dry cutting = dull drills.

## Special Cases

### Deep Holes (Over 3x Diameter)

**Peck drilling**:

1. Drill 1/2 diameter deep
2. Retract fully
3. Clear chips
4. Repeat
5. Increase peck depth as you go

**Why**: Clears chips, cools drill, prevents packing.

### Large Holes (Over 1/2")

**Pilot drilling**:

1. Drill 1/4-1/3 final size
2. Open to final size
3. Reduces load
4. Better finish
5. Easier on machine

### Thin Material

**Issues**:

- Grabbing on breakthrough
- Distortion
- Burrs

**Solutions**:

- Always use a backing material!
- Reduce feed at breakthrough
- Higher speed, lighter feed
- Step drills are for sheet metal

### Interrupted Cuts

Like drilling through weldments:

- Reduce speed 25%
- Steady feed pressure
- Rigid setup crucial
- Expect shorter drill life

## Troubleshooting

### Oversize Holes

**Causes**:

- Dull drill
- Too much speed
- Runout in spindle
- Poor work holding

### Oval Holes

**Causes**:

- Drill walking at start
- Flexible setup
- Bent drill
- Side pressure

### Poor Finish

**Causes**:

- Wrong speed
- No cutting fluid
- Dull drill
- Chips re-cutting

## Quick Reference Chart

| Material   | Speed Multiplier | Notes                   |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Aluminum   | 2x               | Watch for built-up edge |
| Brass      | 2x               | Free cutting            |
| Mild Steel | 1x (baseline)    | Most forgiving          |
| Stainless  | 0.5x             | Keep feeding            |
| Cast Iron  | 1x               | No coolant needed       |
| Plastic    | 3-4x             | Clear chips often       |

## The Reality

These rules get you in the ballpark. From there:

1. Listen to the cut
2. Watch your chips
3. Feel the pressure
4. Adjust as needed

Remember: There's no prize for drilling fast. A steady, controlled cut beats rushing every time. Your drills last longer, holes come out better, and you don't break stuff.

A race car driving buddy of mine taught me; **Speed is nothing without control!**
