# Drill Bit Selection

Not all drill bits are created equal. Here's what you need to know to stop breaking bits and start making proper holes.

## Types of Drills

### Twist Drills - Your Daily Driver

The standard drill bit everyone thinks of. But even these come in varieties:

**Point Angles**:

- **118° point**: Most common at hardware stores
  - Longer cutting edge
  - Good for wood, plastic, aluminum
  - Standard point (not split) - tends to walk or wobble
- **135° point**: This is for metal work
  - Shorter cutting edge (less load)
  - Usually has split point
  - Four cutting edges prevent walking
  - Should be your go-to for metal fabrication work

### Other Drill Types (Know They Exist)

**Annular Cutters**:

- These don't remove center material
- Used in mag drills for thick plate
- Fast but specialized

**Step Drills**:

- Great for sheet metal by hand
- Multiple sizes in one bit
- Limits cut load per step
- Not for thick or hardened materials!

## Drill Materials

### High-Speed Steel (HSS)

Your bread and butter. Comes in several finishes:

**Bright Polish**:

- Polished so chips don't stick
- Good chip evacuation
- This is the standard choice

**Black Oxide**:

- Reduces friction, but only slightly
- Looks cool (doesn't make it better)
- Don't get conned and pay extra for it

**Titanium Nitride (TiN) Coated**:

- That gold coating you see
- NOT made of titanium (Watch out for Amazon marketing BS)
- Lasts slightly longer
- Again, don't pay extra. Generally no better than HSS bits.

### Cobalt Drills

Actually steel with cobalt alloy:

- Use these for stainless steel
- Use these for hardened materials
- More expensive
- Only buy when you need them

## The Split Point Difference

This is what separates good drills from hardware store specials:

**Standard Point (118°)**:

```md
     \     /
      \   /
       \_/

No cutting edge
at center
```

- Center doesn't cut
- Has to deform material before it can start cutting!
- Why drills walk around
- Why your hole in that steel plate took 20 minutes and looks like an oval.

**Split Point (135°)**:

```md
    \ | /
     \|/
      V

Cutting edges
go to center
```

- Four cutting edges
- Cuts immediately on center
- Self-centering
- Worth the extra cost

## What to Buy

### For General Fabrication

**Starter Set**:

- 135° split point HSS
- Fractional sizes 1/16" to 1/2" by 64ths
- Bright finish is fine
- Name brand matters (And USA made if possible)

**Add Later**:

- Number drills - are for tap sizes
- Letter drills - are for reaming
- Cobalt drills - are for stainless
- Larger sizes as you need them

### Skip These

- Titanium coated sets from Uncle Jeff's website or big box stores
- Super cheap imports (100% false economy)
- Fancy coatings for general work
- Specialty grind unless you need it (you probably don't)

## Reading Your Drill Bits

### What to Look For

**Sharp edges**:

- Run your finger carefully along cutting edge
- Should feel sharp (don't cut yourself!)
- Dull = time to sharpen or replace

**Point condition**:

- Both cutting edges same length
- Point centered
- No chips or damage in cutting surfaces

**Flute condition**:

- Clean and polished
- No built-up material
- No gouges or damage

### When to Replace

- Cutting edges chipped
- Point off-center
- Makes more heat than chips
- Holes come out oversized
- Takes excessive pressure

## Drill Bit Care

### Storage

**Do**:

- Keep in index (those metal cases with sizes)
- Store clean and dry
- Keep cutting edges protected
- Sort by size

**Don't**:

- Throw in drawer loose
- Let them bang together
- Store wet or oily
- Mix bit materials (eg: HSS with cobalt)

### Maintenance

**After each use**:

- Wipe clean with oiled rag
- Check cutting edges
- Light oil if storing long term
- Put back in correct slot

**Sharpening** (advanced):

- Drill doctor for small sizes
- Bench grinder for larger
- Keep both edges equal
- Maintain proper angles
- Or just buy new (time vs money)

## Material-Specific Bit Selection

### Aluminum

- 118° work fine, or 135° (but probably overkill)
- High helix for chip evacuation
- Keep sharp
- Watch for built-up edge
- Cut dry

### Mild Steel

- 135° split point is now a good idea
- Standard HSS grade
- Normal helix angle
- Most forgiving material
- Use cutting fluid (WD-40 is fine)

### Stainless Steel

- 135° split point is mandatory
- Cobalt grade is recommended
- Keep feed pressure constant
- Never let it rub
- Use high quality cutting fluid

### Cast Iron

- 118° works well
- No coolant / cutting fluid needed
- Shorter flutes better
- Chips will be powdery

## Summing it up

You don't need every drill bit ever made. Start with:

1. Good quality 135° split point set
2. A few cobalt drills for tough stuff
3. Step drill for sheet metal
4. Keep them sharp and organized

Remember: A sharp $5 drill beats a dull $20 drill every time. Take care of your tools and they'll take care of you.
