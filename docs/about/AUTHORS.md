## About This Wiki

The Machine Shop Tutorials Wiki-Book bridges the gap between traditional 
machining knowledge and modern documentation practices. While machinists 
have passed their craft through apprenticeships and shop floor conversations 
for generations, this wiki captures that oral tradition in a searchable, 
versioned, and collaborative format.

This living document preserves decades of accumulated tricks, techniques, 
and hard-won insights that might otherwise be lost when experienced 
machinists retire. By creating a collaborative repository, we ensure that 
shop floor wisdom is translated into documented best practices that anyone 
can access, contribute to, and learn from.

Johanness brings years of hands-on experience in metal fabrication, CNC 
machining, and shop management. His goal is to democratize access to 
machining knowledge by documenting techniques that traditionally exist 
only in the minds and hands of practitioners.

## Philosophy

> "In the old days, machining knowledge was jealously guarded. Masters would 
> hide their techniques from apprentices, and shops would keep their methods 
> secret. But knowledge wants to be free. By sharing what we know, we all 
> become better machinists."
> 
> — Johanness A. Nilsson
