## About This Wiki

The Machine Shop Tutorials Wiki-Book bridges the gap between traditional
machining knowledge and modern documentation practices. While machinists
have passed their craft through apprenticeships and shop floor conversations
for generations, this wiki captures that oral tradition in a searchable,
versioned, and collaborative format.

This living document preserves decades of accumulated tricks, techniques,
and hard-won insights that might otherwise be lost when experienced
machinists retire. By creating a collaborative repository, we ensure that
shop floor wisdom is translated into documented best practices that anyone
can access, contribute to, and learn from.

Johanness brings years of hands-on experience in metal fabrication, CNC
machining, and shop management. His goal is to democratize access to
machining knowledge by documenting techniques that traditionally exist
only in the minds and hands of practitioners.

## Philosophy

> "In the old days, machining knowledge was jealously guarded. Masters would
> hide their techniques from apprentices, and shops would keep their methods
> secret. But knowledge wants to be free. By sharing what we know, we all
> become masters, and the world becomes a better place for all."
>
> â€” Johanness A. Nilsson
