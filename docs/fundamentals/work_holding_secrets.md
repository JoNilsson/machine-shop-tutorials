# Work Holding Secrets: Because Flying Parts Kill People

Author: Johannes A. Nilsson

## The First Rule of Machining

If it ain't clamped, it ain't staying put. I don't care if it weighs 500
pounds - cutting forces will move it, throw it, or turn it into a
projectile. Good work holding is the difference between going home with all
your fingers and explaining to the ER doc why there's a part embedded in your
skull. Always consider that that forces of inertia and entropy are out to get
you.

## The Physics you didn't learn in shop class

Cutting forces go three ways:

- **Down** - Into the table (usually fine)
- **Sideways** - Trying to slide your part (the sneaky bastard)
- **Up** - Trying to lift your part (the killer)

Your clamps need to fight all three. Gravity only helps with one.

## Basic Clamping Rules

### The 3-2-1 Principle

This is how you make a part stay put without distorting it:

- **3 points** define a plane (bottom of part)
- **2 points** stop rotation (side of part)
- **1 point** stops the last degree of freedom

Over-constrain it and you'll bend your part. Under-constrain it and it'll
move and possibly kill you.

### Clamp Placement

**Good Clamping**:

- **Close to the cut** - support where forces happen
- **On solid sections** - not thin walls
- **Even pressure** - multiple light clamps always beat one gorilla clamp
- **Low on the part** - less leverage for lifting

**Shit Clamping**:

- **Only at the ends** - part bows in middle
- **Over unsupported areas** - crushes the part
- **Too much pressure** - distorts everything
- **High on the part** - creates a lever

## Vise Work

The most common work holding, and the most commonly fucked up.

### Vise Basics

**Jaw Preparation**:

- Keep them clean: one chip changes everything
- Keep them parallel: check with an indicator)
- Keep them true: mill them if needed
- De-burr everything: sharp edges dig in wrong

**Part Preparation**:

- De-burr all edges
- Clean all surfaces
- Check for warping & distortions
- Support thin sections

### Parallels: Your Best Friend

Those hardened bars aren't just spacers:

- Lift the part for tool clearance
- Spread clamping force
- Keep the part square
- Tell you if the part is seated (tap test)

**The Tap Test**: After clamping, tap each parallel. They should both ring
the same. If one's dead, your part is bent or not seated.

### Vise Tricks

**The Penny Trick**: For thin parts, put a penny (or thin parallel) under
one end. Tighten vise until part touches both jaws, then remove penny. Now
you've got even pressure without bending.

**Soft Jaws**: More on these custom tools you can fab to make your life
better later, but they're magic for:

- Holding finished surfaces
- Odd shapes
- Repeat work
- Delicate parts

**Stop Blocks**: Use them. Every time. Repeatability matters more than you
think.

## Soft Jaws: A Superpower

If you're not making soft jaws, you're working too hard.

### When to Use Them

- **Round parts** in a vise
- **Finished surfaces** you can't mark
- **Odd shapes** that won't sit flat
- **Production runs** of the same part
- **Thin walls** that regular jaws would crush

### Making Soft Jaws

1. **Start with aluminum** (6061 is perfect)
2. **Machine in place** (critical for accuracy)
3. **Cut the profile** 0.001-0.002" undersize
4. **Add relief cuts** where needed
5. **Drill and tap** for stops if needed

### Pro Tips

- **Number them** - Soft jaws are married to specific jobs
- **Save them** - Future runs are easier
- **Machine both sides** - Double your utility
- **Add features** - Built-in stops, part ejectors, etc.

## Custom Fixtures: When Vises Aren't Enough

Sometimes you need to build your own work holding.

### Fixture Plates

Start with a flat plate:

- Aluminum for most work
- Steel for heavy cutting
- Mic-6 for critical flatness

Add features:

- Tapped holes for clamps
- Dowel pins for location
- Relief cuts for chips
- Coolant channels if fancy

### Toggle Clamps

The fast-change artist:

- Repeatable pressure
- Quick loading
- Adjustable
- Don't trust the ratings (use 2x safety factor)

### Vacuum Fixtures

For thin, flat parts:

- Great for sheets
- No clamp marks
- Limited cutting force
- Needs good seals
- Expensive and complex to set-up

## Magnetic Work Holding

Magnets are magic, but respect them.

### Magnetic Chucks

#### Pros

- Fast setup
- No clamp interference
- Even holding
- Great for grinding

#### Cons

- Only ferrous materials
- Limited holding power
- Chips stick everywhere
- Can magnetize your part or tooling

### Safety Rules

- **Never** trust magnets alone for heavy cuts
- **Always** use backup clamps for roughing
- **Check** holding power before cutting
- **Demagnetize** parts and tools after (unless you want chips forever)

## Avoiding Distortion

The part was straight until you clamped it. Here's why:

### Causes of Distortion

- **Over-clamping** - gorilla syndrome
- **Uneven support** - part rocks
- **Heat buildup** - expansion fighting clamps
- **Residual stress** - material wants to move
- **Point loading** - clamps too small

### Solutions

#### Jack Screws

Support the middle of long parts

- Adjustable height
- Multiple contact points
- Takes the bow out

#### Step Clamps

Spread the load

- Use the right height
- Keep them level
- Multiple small better than few large

#### Indicating While Clamping

Watch the distortion happen

- Indicates part while tightening
- Stop when movement starts
- Find the sweet spot

## Advanced Techniques

### The Sacrificial Plate Method

For through-holes and full profiling:

1. Attach part to aluminum plate (superglue, VHB tape, or screws)
2. Clamp the plate, not the part
3. Machine through into the plate
4. Replace plate as needed

### The Ice Fixture

For tiny or delicate parts:

1. Freeze part in ice block
2. Machine while frozen
3. Melt to release
4. Seriously, this works!

### Superglue Fixturing

The controversial method:

- Use good CA glue
- Clean surfaces perfectly
- Heat to release (150Â°C)
- Great for small, flat parts
- NEVER trust for heavy cuts!

## Work Holding for Specific Operations

### Drilling

- Prevent spin: drill grab is real
- Support the exit side: prevent blowout burrs
- Clamp near the hole: minimize flex

### Tapping

- Rock solid holding: taps don't forgive
- Perpendicular setup: crooked threads suck
- Easy chip clearing: or broken taps

### Profiling

- Access all sides
- Minimal clamp interference
- Consider order of operations

### Finishing

- Soft contact only
- Even pressure
- Quick changes
- No marks allowed

## Common Fuck-ups

### The Part Moved

- Insufficient clamping
- Forgot to tighten something
- Chips under the part
- Coolant hydraulics

### The Part Flew

- Climb milling with weak setup
- Grab during drilling
- Clamps too high
- Trust in magnets alone

### The Part Distorted

- Over-clamping
- Uneven support
- Heat with no expansion room
- Released internal stress

## The Golden Rules

1. **If you're scared of the setup, fix it** - Trust the _Gut Brain_. Your
   gut knows!
2. **Two pounds of clamp for one pound of cut** - Overkill saves lives
3. **Check after first cut** - Parts move, clamps loosen
4. **Plan the whole job** - Don't paint yourself into a corner
5. **Clean everything twice** - One chip will ruin everything

## Investment Priorities

Start cheap, upgrade what you use most:

1. **Good vise** - I like Kurt brand, or get some clone equivalent
2. **Parallel set** - Import is fine to start - A Starrett set is bought
   once and used for life
3. **Step clamp kit** - Get a decent one, or possibly two - You can't have
   too many
4. **123 blocks** - Incredibly versatile
5. **Soft jaw material** - Always have some ready
6. **Bessey Clamps** - Another thing you can never have enough of

## Final Words

Work holding is where machining gets creative. There's always a way to hold
the weird-ass part the engineer designed - you just might need to invent it.
Start simple, build your bag of tricks, and remember: the best work holding is
the one that lets you go home with the same number of fingers and eyes you
arrived with.

And if you hear that sound - that tiny "tink" of a part shifting - STOP.
That's the sound of shit about to go real wrong. Re-clamp it, check it, and
try again. The part can be replaced. Your face cannot.
