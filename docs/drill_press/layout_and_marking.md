# Layout and Marking - Getting Holes in the Right Place

Precision starts with proper layout. The difference between professional work
and amateur results often comes down to taking the time to mark your work
accurately. This chapter covers the tools and techniques for laying out hole
locations with the precision your work demands.

## Marking and Layout - Getting Holes in the Right Place

The first step to getting a nice hole is placing it correctly. I have used
a marker with a speed square on projects, but that is a rough method. While
usually sufficient for fabrication work, you have a wide line and must
eyeball the center.

## Marking Methods (Rough to Precise)

### Sharpie and Square - Quick and Dirty

What I use for most of my fabrication work:

- Sharpie marker (medium point)
- Speed square or combo square
- Mark your lines
- Eyeball the intersection
- Wide line = ±1/16" accuracy at best
- Fine for most fab work

### Scribe Lines - Getting Serious

When ±1/16" won't cut it:

_Never be without a good quality pocket scribe!_

For more precision, I use a scribe. I particularly like a small square that
combines features of a combination square and a machinist square:

![Starrett 150mm Machinists Square](/images/machinists_square.png)  
_That little combo square/machinist square hybrid:_

- Set length precisely
- Lock it down
- Scribe along the edge
- Way faster than measuring each time
- Has a built in scribe (don't lose it!)

You can set the length needed and scribe along the edge. For even more precision,
layout fluid helps you see scribed lines clearly against the metal surface. If you
lack layout fluid, coloring with a marker can help track lines, though it
does not work as well.

### Caliper Scribing - Shop Controversial

Yeah, it makes the internet mad, but it works:

1. Set your dimension
2. One jaw on edge of material
3. Drag to scribe line
4. Cheap calipers work fine for this

The problem is it's hard to see scribed lines and they look like other scratches.

### Layout Fluid - Machinist Territory

When you need to see what you're doing:

**Blue dye** (Dykem or similar):

1. Clean surface
2. Apply thin coat
3. Let dry (30 seconds)
4. Scribe shows bright metal
5. Removes with acetone

**Poor man's version**:

- Jumbo Chisel Sharpie over the area
- Scribe through it
- Not as good but works
- Fills other scratches so you can track your line

## Center Punching - Don't Skip This

Center punching is essential for hitting your position and preventing drill
wandering, especially when hand drilling. I use old-school style center
punches with a 90-degree point. These work well on most materials including
aluminum and steel, giving a good point for the drill to follow.

### Automatic Center Punches

The spring-loaded ones are my preference for most work:

**Good**:

- Consistent depth
- One-handed operation
- No hammer needed

**Bad**:

- Can slide if you aren't careful
- Tension adjustment must be appropriate for material
- Spring mechanisms can fail (Buy Starrett)

Automatic center punches exist where you just press and it clicks to make
your dimple. However, they can slide around, so some prefer traditional ones.

### Manual Center Punches - The Three Taps Technique

More accurate, but not always necessary:

**Center Punching Technique**:

1. Sharp 90° point
2. Place exactly on mark
3. Light tap first (just a dimple)
4. Check position
5. Harder tap if good
6. Deep enough to guide drill

**Pro tip**: Three taps!

- First: tiny mark
- Check with magnifier if critical
- Second: working dimple
- Third: only if hand drilling

Center drills are rigid drills that can make indentations on a drill
press, though I rarely use them for fabrication projects, reserving them for
machining work.

## Transfer Techniques

### Transfer Punching Methods

When you need to match existing parts:

**Transfer Punches**:

Best method for accuracy:

1. Align parts
2. Clamp together
3. Transfer punch through holes
4. Perfect centers transferred

**Direct Marking**:

When parts nest together:

1. Clamp in position
2. Drill through both
3. Or mark through with scribe
4. Works for one-offs

### Grid Pattern Layout Techniques

For mounting plates, etc:

**Method 1 - Measure each**:

- Slow but works
- Errors accumulate
- Double-check everything

**Method 2 - Edge reference** (my preferred method):

- Measure from same edge
- No accumulation
- More accurate

## Common Mistakes

### Layout Errors to Avoid

**Measuring from wrong edge**:

- Always measure from machined surfaces
- Avoid rough-cut edges
- Use consistent reference points

**Poor center punch placement**:

- Punch slips off mark
- Wrong angle creates wandering
- Too light won't guide drill

**Accumulating errors**:

- Each measurement adds error
- Use consistent datums
- Check critical dimensions twice

**Not accounting for drill wander**:

- Even good punches can't fix bad technique
- Split-point drills are more forgiving
- Pilot holes help with accuracy

it right than to remake the part.
