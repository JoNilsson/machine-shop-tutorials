# Work Holding and Safety - Keeping Parts from Becoming Projectiles

Safety isn't optional in metalworking - it's what keeps you able to work
another day. Proper work holding protects both you and your work quality.
When parts spin free, they become dangerous projectiles that can cause
serious injury. This chapter covers the tools and techniques for keeping
your work secure.

## Work Holding - The Foundation of Safe Drilling

Proper work holding is crucial for safety. Many people hold material by hand,
but if the drill catches and rotates the piece, it becomes like a swinging
knife. While dedicated clamps for drill press slots exist, I find them
cumbersome.

## The Modified Table Solution

What I did (game changer):

Instead, I drilled 5/8-inch holes in my table to use fixture table hardware
for holding material in place. This keeps everything locked down and provides
options for anti-rotation stops.

1. Drilled 5/8" holes in table
2. Grid pattern about 3" apart
3. Use fixture table hardware
4. Quick positioning
5. Rock solid holding

Now I can:

- Drop pins anywhere
- Use standard clamps
- Set up stops quickly
- No fighting T-slots

## Drill Press Vise - Your Best Friend

The drill press vise is the bread and butter for drilling smaller pieces. The
challenge is holding them in place. Rather than constantly repositioning bolts
through slots, I use clamps to hold the vise in position after aligning the
part under the drill.

**My preferred method** (fast):

1. Position vise under spindle
2. Find hole with center punch
3. Clamp vise to table
4. Quick and repeatable

## Advanced Vise Work Techniques

### Parallels

- Lift work above jaws
- Consistent height
- Prevents jaw marks
- Essential for accurate work

### V-blocks

- Hold round stock
- Prevents rotation
- Centers automatically
- Magnetic ones are handy

### Soft jaws

- Protect finished surfaces
- Custom shapes
- Aluminum or copper
- Make your own

## Toggle Clamps for Production Work

For repetitive work:

- Mount to fixture plate
- Quick open/close
- Consistent pressure
- Hands stay clear
- Worth the investment

## Work Holding Kit Recommendations

### Must Have

- 6" drill press vise
- Set of clamps
- Step blocks
- Parallels (1/8" to 1")
- V-blocks

### Should Have

- Angle plate
- Toggle clamps
- Soft jaw material
- Hold-down set
- Fixture plate

### Nice to Have

- Magnetic vise jaws
- Rotary table
- Sine vise
- Quick-change fixtures

## Safety Rules - Non-Negotiable

### The Five Commandments

1. **Never hold work by hand** - Ever. Period.
2. **Check clearances** - Is your spindle hitting your clamps?
3. **Secure loose items** - Rags, rulers, shirt cuffs, etc.
4. **Know your exit** - Things go wrong fast! Where is the e-stop button?
5. **Keep hands clear** - 4" minimum from bit, more = better

### Real Safety Examples

That innocent piece of aluminum becomes a spinning blade when a drill grabs.
I've seen:

- Parts thrown across shops
- Fingers broken
- Deep lacerations
- Drills snapped
- Tables gouged

**The rule**: If you can hold it by hand, it's small enough to clamp.

### When Things Go Wrong

Drill presses have tremendous torque. When a drill bit grabs:

- Material spins instantly
- Sharp edges become weapons
- Fingers get caught
- Damage happens fast

**Prevention is everything**:

- Proper work holding
- Correct speeds and feeds
- Sharp drill bits
- Good technique
- Safety equipment

### Emergency Procedures

**If the drill grabs**:

1. Hit the stop switch immediately
2. Don't try to catch spinning parts
3. Clear the area
4. Let it stop on its own
5. Assess damage safely

**Power failures**:

- Know where your manual release is
- Have backup lighting
- Never leave work unattended
- Secure loose items first

## Table Modifications

### Drilling Your Table

Many hesitate to modify their drill press table, but it's one of the best
improvements you can make:

**Before drilling**:

- Plan your hole pattern
- Use quality hardware
- Consider future needs
- Make it reversible if possible

**Hole spacing**:

- 3" grid works for most work
- Closer for small parts
- Further apart saves time
- Match your clamp sets

### Alternative Solutions

If you can't modify your table:

- Removable sub-tables
- Magnetic bases
- Auxiliary fixtures
- Clamp-on systems
