# Material-Specific Drilling Techniques

Different materials behave differently under the drill bit. What works
perfectly for mild steel might destroy your drill when used on stainless.
This chapter covers the specific techniques, speeds, and considerations for
various materials you'll encounter in metal fabrication.

## Drilling Stainless Steel

Stainless steel presents unique challenges that demand specific techniques and
tools. Its tendency to work harden, combined with poor heat dissipation and
high strength, makes it one of the more bastardly common materials to drill
successfully.

### Understanding Work Hardening

Stainless steel work hardens rapidly when subjected to friction without
cutting action. Once hardened, the surface becomes significantly more
difficult to penetrate, often ruining drill bits and requiring spot annealing
or special carbide drills to break through. Prevention is critical: maintain
constant feed pressure, never allow the drill to rub without cutting, and
avoid dwelling in one spot.

### Drill Bit Selection for Stainless

Cobalt drills (M35 or M42 grades) provide the best balance of hardness and
toughness for stainless steel. The 5-8% cobalt content maintains cutting edge
integrity at higher temperatures. Carbide drills offer superior wear
resistance but require rigid setups due to their brittleness. For occasional
stainless drilling, sharp HSS drills work adequately with proper technique.

Split-point geometry is essential for stainless steel. The self-centering
action prevents walking, while the improved chip evacuation reduces heat
buildup. Some manufacturers offer specialized stainless steel drill designs
with modified flute geometry and enhanced web thinning for better penetration.
These specialized bits are awesome, but they are 4x the cost of a good HSS bit.
If you have the budget for specialized bits, go for it. Future you will thank
you for the extra time he had at the pub that night. But don't think you can't
get by with regular HSS. It all comes down to technique!

### Speed and Feed Considerations

The speed question for stainless steel often causes confusion because the
advice differs between operations. For drilling, stainless steel requires
significantly slower speeds than mild steel - typically 30-40% of mild steel
speeds. A 1/2-inch drill should run approximately 200-280 RPM in stainless
versus 700 RPM in mild steel.

Why slower for drilling? The key is heat management. Drilling creates intense
localized heat with limited chip evacuation paths. Stainless steel's poor
thermal conductivity means heat concentrates at the cutting edge rather than
dissipating through the workpiece. Higher speeds generate exponentially more
heat through friction, causing rapid tool wear and work hardening. The slower
speed allows the cutting edges to shear material cleanly without generating
excessive heat that would destroy the drill bit.

However, when _sawing_ stainless you almost always wanna opt for higher speeds
â€”this seeming contradiction makes sense when you consider the differences.
Band saws and circular saws have continuous chip evacuation, multiple teeth
sharing the cutting load, and often flood coolant directly in the cut zone.
The higher surface speed prevents teeth from dwelling and work hardening the
material, while the distributed cutting action and superior cooling manage
the heat way more effectively than the small tip of a drill bit!

The critical difference: drilling concentrates all cutting force and heat
generation in one small area with limited cooling access, while sawing
distributes these factors across multiple teeth with better heat dissipation.
Feed pressure must be positive and constant regardless - light pecking causes
work hardening while excessive pressure breaks tools.

The feed rate should produce continuous chips. Powdery chips indicate work
hardening is occurring, while long stringy chips suggest optimal cutting
conditions. Blue or straw-colored chips indicate excessive heat - reduce
speed or increase coolant flow immediately.

### Cooling and Lubrication for Stainless

Cutting fluid is absolutely critical when drilling stainless steel. Sulfur-
based cutting oils provide the best results, though environmental regulations
may restrict their use. Water-soluble coolants work adequately when mixed to
proper concentrations (typically 10-15% for stainless). Apply coolant
continuously throughout the cut, not just at the start.

For deep holes, peck drilling becomes necessary despite work hardening risks.
Withdraw completely every 1-2 drill diameters to clear chips and reapply
coolant. Minimize dwell time during withdrawal to prevent the drill from
rubbing and work hardening the hole bottom.

### Troubleshooting Common Problems

Drill bits wearing prematurely usually indicates excessive speed or
insufficient coolant. Reduce RPM by 25% and ensure continuous coolant flow.
Holes coming out oversized often result from drill flexing - check for
excessive runout, worn spindle bearings, or inadequate drill support.

Work hardened spots appear as shiny, glazed areas that resist drilling. Once
formed, options include: spot annealing with a torch (if permitted), using
cobalt or carbide drills at very slow speeds with maximum coolant, or
drilling a smaller pilot hole first to reduce cutting forces.

## Aluminum Drilling Techniques

### Material Properties

Aluminum is generally easier to drill than steel, but it presents its own
challenges:

- Soft material can cause built-up edge on drill bits
- Excellent thermal conductivity spreads heat quickly
- Tends to gall and stick to cutting edges
- Chips can clog flutes in deeper holes

### Speed and Feed Parameters

**Speed**: Use 2x the speed you would for steel

- 1/2" hole: 1400 RPM (vs 700 for steel)
- Faster speeds prevent built-up edge formation
- Higher speeds improve surface finish

**Feed**: Moderate pressure

- Steady chip production
- Avoid light feeds that cause rubbing
- Clear chips frequently to prevent packing

### Drill Bit Selection

**For aluminum**:

- Standard HSS works fine
- Bright finish prevents sticking
- Sharp drills essential
- Split point helpful but not critical

**Avoid**:

- Dull drill bits (cause tearing)
- Black oxide coatings (chips stick more)
- Excessive coatings

### Cutting Fluids

**Best choices**:

- WD-40 in a pinch
- Water-based coolants
- Light cutting oils
- Even soap and water works

**Application**:

- Keep drill and work wet
- Helps with chip evacuation
- Prevents built-up edge
- Improves surface finish

## Cast Iron Considerations

### Material Characteristics

- Abrasive material
- Creates powdery chips
- No coolant typically needed
- Hard on cutting edges

### Drilling Parameters

- Use steel speeds (1x multiplier)
- Steady feed pressure
- Expect shorter drill life
- Plan for frequent sharpening

### Special Considerations

- Creates dust, not chips
- Use dust collection if possible
- Harder on equipment
- May need carbide for production work

## Brass and Bronze

### Easy Drilling Materials

- Cut freely with standard techniques
- Use 2x steel speeds
- Good surface finishes possible
- Standard HSS drills work well

### Considerations

- Can work harden if rubbed
- Some alloys contain lead (ventilation!)
- May require deburring
- Generally forgiving materials
