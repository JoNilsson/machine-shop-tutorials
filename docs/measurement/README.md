# Measurement and Quality Control

How to quality check if your parts are actually good, and avoid making
expensive scrap.

## Tutorials

1. [Basic Measuring Tools](./basic_measuring_tools.md) - Calipers,
   micrometers, and how not to lie to yourself
2. [Surface Finish](./surface_finish.md) - What those Ra numbers mean and
   how to achieve them
3. [Geometric Tolerancing Basics](./gdt_basics.md) - When Â±0.005" isn't
   good enough
4. [Shop Floor Inspection](./shop_floor_inspection.md) - Checking parts
   without a CMM

## Why This Matters

You can't improve what you can't measure. And in machining, the
difference between a good part and scrap is often less than the thickness
of a human hair.

These tutorials aim to teach you:

- How to use measuring tools properly
- What all those symbols on prints actually mean
- How to check parts efficiently without spending all day measuring
- When good enough is actually good enough

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:

- Basic shop math (decimals, fractions)
- Reading simple prints
- Handling delicate tools without dropping them

If you're still converting 0.001" to fractions, start with the
[fundamental skills](../fundamental_skills/) section first.

## The Golden Rule

**Measure twice, cut once** sounds like some boomer advice, but it'll save
your ass more times than you can count.

The corollary: **Never trust, always verify**.
