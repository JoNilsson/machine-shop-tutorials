## Why This Shit Matters

The band saw is usually the first tool to touch your stock. Get it wrong
and you're:

- Fighting crooked cuts through the whole job
- Wasting material with bad angles
- Burning through expensive blades
- Making more work for yourself or the shop manager

Master the band saw and every job starts easier.

## Prerequisites

You should know:

- Basic shop safety
- How to mark and measure
- Difference between ferrous and non-ferrous metals

## The Golden Rules

1. **Let the saw do the work** - Forcing it just breaks blades
2. **Right blade for the material** - One blade doesn't cut all
3. **Check square before long cuts** - 5 minutes setup saves hours of
   frustration
