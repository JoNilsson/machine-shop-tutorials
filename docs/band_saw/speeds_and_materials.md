# Speeds and Materials

Getting the speed right means the difference between blades lasting months
or minutes. Here's what actually works.

## Understanding Band Speed

Measured in FPM (Feet Per Minute) - how fast the blade travels.

### Why Speed Matters

**Too fast**:

- Burns teeth
- Work hardens material
- Breaks blades
- Blue chips (bad)

**Too slow**:

- Rubs instead of cutting
- Takes forever
- Dulls blade
- Wastes time

**Just right**:

- Consistent chip color
- Smooth cutting
- Blade stays cool
- Maximum life

## Speed by Material

### Aluminum and Soft Alloys

**Speed**: 250-350 FPM

**Characteristics**:

- Cuts fast
- Chips can weld
- Needs chip clearance
- Watch for gumming

**Tips**:

- Use cutting fluid
- Coarser teeth
- Keep blade sharp
- Clear chips often

### Mild Steel

**Speed**: 100-150 FPM

**The baseline**:

- Most common material
- Forgiving
- Good chip formation
- Standard everything

**Best practices**:

- Always use coolant
- 10-14 TPI typical
- Medium feed pressure
- Listen to the cut

### Stainless Steel

**Speed**: 60-80 FPM

**The problem child**:

- Work hardens easily
- Needs constant feed
- Never let it rub
- Slow and steady

**Critical points**:

- Heavy coolant flow
- Positive rake teeth
- Never stop in cut
- Replace when dull

### Cast Iron

**Speed**: 80-100 FPM

**Special case**:

- Cut DRY only
- Powdery chips
- Abrasive
- Messy

**Remember**:

- No coolant ever
- Wear dust mask
- Clean saw after
- Expect shorter blade life

### Tool Steel (Annealed)

**Speed**: 50-70 FPM

**Tough stuff**:

- Very slow
- Maximum coolant
- Light steady pressure
- Premium blades only

### Brass and Bronze

**Speed**: 200-300 FPM

**Free cutting**:

- Similar to aluminum
- Chips break well
- Little burr
- Pleasant to cut

### Plastics

**Speed**: 300-500 FPM

**Varies widely**:

- Some melt
- Some chip
- Test first
- Usually no coolant

## Quick Reference Chart

| Material | Speed (FPM) | Coolant | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Aluminum | 250-350 | Yes | Watch chip welding |
| Mild Steel | 100-150 | Yes | Standard baseline |
| Stainless | 60-80 | Heavy | Keep feeding |
| Cast Iron | 80-100 | NEVER | Dry cut only |
| Tool Steel | 50-70 | Yes | Go slow |
| Brass | 200-300 | Optional | Free cutting |
| Copper | 150-200 | Yes | Can grab |
| Plastic | 300-500 | Usually no | Test first |

## Feed Rate and Pressure

Speed is only half the equation.

### General Guidelines

**Let the saw do the work**:

- Gravity feed on horizontal
- Light steady pressure vertical
- Never force
- If smoking, too much pressure

### Material-Specific Feed

**Aluminum**:

- Medium to fast feed
- Don't dwell
- Keep chips moving

**Steel**:

- Medium steady feed
- Consistent pressure
- Watch chip color

**Stainless**:

- Never stop feeding
- Constant pressure
- No dwelling
- Critical!

**Cast Iron**:

- Light pressure
- Let it cut
- Don't force

## Reading Your Chips

Chips tell the truth about your setup.

### Good Chips

**Steel**:

- Silver to light brown
- Curled nicely
- Consistent size
- Not too hot

**Aluminum**:

- Shiny
- May spiral
- Not discolored
- Clean breaks

**Stainless**:

- Tightly curled
- Consistent
- Not blue/purple
- Controlled heat

### Bad Chips - What They Mean

**Blue/Purple** = Too fast or no coolant
**Powder** = Blade dull or wrong TPI
**Long strings** = Feed too light
**Thick chunks** = Feed too heavy
**Welded chips** = Need more coolant

## Coolant Considerations

When and how much matters.

### Standard Mix

**Water-soluble oil**:

- 5-10% concentration
- Check with refractometer
- Adjust as needed
- Change when rancid

### Flow Rate

**General cutting**:

- Steady stream
- Cover blade width
- Wash chips away
- Keep blade cool

**Heavy cutting**:

- Flood coolant
- Maximum flow
- Critical for life
- Don't be stingy

### When Extra Coolant Helps

- Stainless steel (always)
- Deep cuts
- Production runs
- Maximum blade life
- Expensive material

## Adjusting for Conditions

Real world isn't textbook.

### Thick Sections

**Adjustments**:

- Reduce speed 10-20%
- Increase coolant
- Steady pressure
- Watch for heat

### Thin Materials

**Changes needed**:

- Finer teeth
- Higher speed OK
- Light pressure
- Support material

### Bundle Cutting

**Multiple pieces**:

- Reduce speed 20%
- Clamp tight
- Extra coolant
- Expect shorter blade life

### Hard Spots

**Dealing with variations**:

- Slow down
- Let blade work
- Don't force
- May need carbide

## Troubleshooting Speed Issues

### Blade Wearing Too Fast

**Check**:

- Speed too high?
- Coolant working?
- Right blade?
- Material harder than expected?

### Cutting Too Slow

**Look for**:

- Speed too low?
- Blade dull?
- Not enough pressure?
- Wrong TPI?

### Poor Finish

**Investigate**:

- Vibration?
- Speed mismatch?
- Blade condition?
- Guide adjustment?

### Crooked Cuts

**Common causes**:

- Uneven blade wear
- One side cutting faster
- Guide problems
- Feed issues

## Production Tips

### Speed Changes

**When to adjust**:

- Different material
- Blade wearing
- Finish problems
- Time constraints

**How much**:

- Start conservative
- 10% adjustments
- Listen to cut
- Watch chips

### Optimizing for Production

**Blade life priority**:

- Run slower
- Maximum coolant
- Perfect setup
- Consistent results

**Speed priority**:

- Push limits carefully
- Watch blade temp
- More blade changes
- Risk vs reward

## Special Cases

### Hardened Materials

**If you must**:

- Carbide blade
- 30-50 FPM max
- Flood coolant
- Expect problems
- Consider alternatives

### Exotic Alloys

**Research first**:

- Call blade manufacturer
- Start very slow
- Test cuts
- Document what works

### Mixed Materials

**Laminated/welded**:

- Use slower material speed
- Reduce 20% more
- Expect blade wear
- No shortcuts

## The Reality Check

Charts are guidelines, not gospel:

1. Start with book speed
2. Listen to your saw
3. Watch your chips
4. Adjust as needed
5. Document what works

Every saw is different. What works on the old DoAll might not work on the
new import. Learn your machine.

## Quick Setup Guide

For any new material:

1. **Look up recommended speed**
2. **Set 10% slower to start**
3. **Use appropriate blade**
4. **Full coolant flow**
5. **Make test cut**
6. **Adjust based on results**
7. **Record settings**

## The Bottom Line

Right speed + right feed + right blade = good cuts

Get any one wrong and you're:

- Burning blades
- Making scrap
- Wasting time
- Getting frustrated

Take 5 minutes to set up properly. Your blades will last longer, cuts
will be better, and you'll spend less time fighting the saw.
