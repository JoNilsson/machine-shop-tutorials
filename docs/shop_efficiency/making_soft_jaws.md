# Making Soft Jaws: Your Secret Production Weapon

Author: Johannes A. Nilsson

## Why Soft Jaws Will Change Your Life

Hard jaws are great for general work, but soft jaws are what separate
the pros from the weekend warriors. Custom jaws mean perfect holding,
no marking, and repeatability that is the only way to make high
production work sustainable and profitable.

## Material Selection

### Aluminum (The Standard)

#### 6061-T6

- Machines like butter
- Strong enough for almost all work
- Cheap enough to experiment with
- Won't mark steel parts

#### 7075-T6

- When 6061 isn't strong enough
- Better for heavy cuts
- More expensive
- Harder to machine

#### Cast Aluminum

- Cheap as dirt
- Machines okay
- Less strong
- Good for light duty

### Alternative Materials

#### Delrin/Acetal

- Won't mark anything
- Great for polished parts
- Limited holding power
- Too expensive

#### Brass

- Won't mark steel
- Heavy (good for vibration)
- Also expensive
- Specific applications only

#### Steel

- For serious gripping
- When aluminum won't cut it
- Pain in the ass to machine
- Lasts forever

## Basic Soft Jaw Design

### The Fundamentals

Every soft jaw needs:

1. **Relief cuts** - So chips don't pack
2. **Proper depth** - Usually 0.100-0.250" grip
3. **Draft angle** - 1-2° helps part release
4. **Location features** - Stops, pins, or whatever is clever and works

### Design Process

1. **Measure your part** (the actual part, not the print)
2. **Sketch the grip profile**
3. **Add 0.001-0.002" clearance** (parts need to go in)
4. **Plan your operations** (how will you machine it?)
5. **Add features** (stops, ejectors, etc.)

## Machining Soft Jaws

### Initial Setup

**CRITICAL**: Machine soft jaws IN PLACE on your vise. Never remove
and replace - they won't be true.

1. **Install blanks** in vise
2. **Tighten to working pressure** (not gorilla tight)
3. **Face the blank tops**
4. **Machine register surface** (only if needed)

### The Two-Step Process

#### Step 1: Roughing

- Leave 0.010" stock
- Use bigger tools
- Don't worry about finish
- Clear chips often

#### Step 2: Finishing

- Final dimension
- Good surface finish
- Light cuts
- Spring passes help

### Cutting the Profile

#### For Round Parts

```text
1. Find center with indicator
2. Bore to diameter - 0.001"
3. Check with test part
4. Adjust if needed
```

#### For Square Parts

```text
1. Mill first surface
2. Measure from fixed jaw
3. Mill second surface
4. Verify with part
```

#### For Weird Shapes

```text
1. Cry a little
2. Make a plan
3. Remove material that isn't soft jaw
4. Test frequently
```

## Advanced Features

### Part Stops

Built-in stops = perfect repeatability

**Types**:

- Milled shoulders
- Inserted pins
- Adjustable screws
- Removable blocks

**Placement**:

- Against solid material
- Where part is strong
- Clear of cutting area
- Easy to clean

### Part Ejectors

Because digging parts out sucks

**Spring-Loaded Pins**:

- McMaster and Grainger have them
- Drill and press in
- Part pops out when vise opens
- Fucking magical!

**Air Ejection**:

- Drill passages
- Connect to shop air
- Blast part out
- You are wearing safety glasses right?

### Multiple Operations

**Flip Jaws**:

- Machine both sides
- Op 1 on side A
- Op 2 on side B
- Perfect for production

**Family Jaws**:

- Multiple part profiles
- One set of jaws
- Label clearly
- Save setup time

## Specific Applications

### Thin Wall Parts

**The Problem**: Regular jaws crush thin walls

**The Solution**:

- Full profile support
- Even pressure distribution
- Relief for distortion
- Light clamping pressure

### Second Operation Work

**The Challenge**: Holding machined surfaces without marking

**Solutions**:

- Precision pockets
- Soft contact surfaces
- Positive stops
- Minimal contact area

### Production Runs

**Requirements**:

- Fast loading
- Positive location
- Chip clearance
- Durability

**Features**:

- Spring stops
- Air blast
- Quick visual checks
- Wear indicators

## Organization and Storage

### Labeling System

Every set of jaws needs:

- Job number and/or Part number
- Date made
- Critical dimensions
- Which vise they fit

**Label Methods**:

- Engraving (permanent)
- Stamping (quick)
- Tags (flexible)
- Sharpie (temporary, until you make one of the above)

### Storage Solutions

**Pegboard System**:

- Visible storage
- Easy access
- Takes wall space, great if you have that to spare
- Quickly allows you to see the inventory (nothing beats that
  immediacy)

**Drawer System**:

- Protected from chips and calcium dust
- Compact storage
- Harder to find, takes more time
- Needs good labels

**Job Boxes**:

_This one is really only for remote work situation, site
installations, etc._

- Jaws stay with job
- Everything together
- Mobile
- Higher risk of loss

## Cost Justification

### The Math

**Traditional Setup**:

- 15 minutes per part
- Marking/scrapping on work
- Inconsistent work holding
- Higher potential for work to end up in the scrap pile and not
  the parts bin

**Soft Jaw Setup**:

- 30 seconds per part
- Zero marking
- Perfect repeatability
- Higher speeds/feeds possible
- Near zero work losses

**Break Even**: Usually 10-20 parts

### Hidden Benefits

- Reduced operator stress
- Better surface finish
- Ability to hold closer tolerances
- Consumer / Engineer will be impressed by no marks
- Repeat jobs are easier to run
- Key for production efficiency

## Tips and Tricks

### The Penny Test

After machining, put a penny in the jaw. Close vise. If penny bends
uniformly, jaws are parallel.

### The Wax Treatment (For Aluminum Parts)

Paste wax on aluminum jaws prevents aluminum parts from galling.

### The Sacrificial Layer

Machine jaws 0.030" deeper than needed. Reface when worn.

### The Reference Edge

Always machine from the fixed jaw side for consistency.

### The Boring Bar Trick

For deep jaws, use a boring bar instead of long end mills.

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Tightening During Machining

- Jaws distort
- Profile is wrong when relaxed
- Part won't fit
- Start over, ya dingus

### Insufficient Relief

- Chips pack
- Part rocks
- Accuracy suffers
- Add more relief

### Wrong Clearance

- Too tight: Part won't load
- Too loose: Part moves
- Test with actual part
- Adjust as needed

### Forgetting Draft

- Part sticks
- Need to hammer it out
- Damages part and jaws
- 1-2° prevents this

## Maintenance

### Daily

- Blow out chips
- Check for burrs
- Wipe with oil
- Visual inspection

### Weekly

- Detailed cleaning
- Check accuracy
- Touch up burrs
- Verify stops

### As Needed

- Reface worn surfaces
- Replace damaged features
- Update labels
- Document changes

## Final Wisdom

Soft jaws are like a Tailored Italian Suit - they're made for one
specific purpose, and they do that purpose perfectly. The time you
spend making them is paid back tenfold in production efficiency,
stress reduction, and most importantly the final part quality.

Start simple. Your first soft jaws don't need every fancy feature.
Make basic jaws that hold your part securely without marking. As you
get comfortable, add features. Before long, you'll wonder how you
ever lived without them.

And remember - the best soft jaws are the ones that make the job
easier, not the ones that look prettiest. You know what I always say,
"_Function over form, **always!**_"
