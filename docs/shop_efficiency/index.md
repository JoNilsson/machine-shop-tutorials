# Shop Efficiency Tutorials

This section covers some more advanced tools and techniques that help
you work faster and more efficiently in the machine shop.

## Tutorials

1. [Quick Change Tooling](./quick_change_tooling.md) - Learn about QC
   tool post systems and how they save setup time
2. [Soft Jaws](./making_soft_jaws.md) - Make custom workholding that
   protects parts and speeds up production
3. [Shop-Made Tools](./shop_made_tools.md) - Build your own cutting
   tools for special operations

## What You Can Learn

These tutorials focus on the techniques that separate hobbyists from
production professionals

### Time Savers

- **Quick Change Tooling**: Stop wasting 20 minutes every time you
  change tools. QC tool posts let you swap tools in seconds and return
  to the exact same height.
- **Soft Jaws**: Custom aluminum jaws that hold odd-shaped parts
  perfectly. Make a set in 30 minutes, use them for years.
- **Shop-Made Tools**: Can't find the right cutter? Make your own.
  We'll show you how to grind fly cutters, boring bars, and form tools.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into these efficiency techniques, make sure you're comfortable with:

- Basic lathe and mill operations
- Reading dial indicators
- Finding edges accurately
- Proper work holding

If any of those sound fuzzy, make sure you have got the
[fundamental skills](../fundamentals/index.md) first.

### Why This Matters

The difference between taking 4 hours to make a part and taking 1 hour
often comes down to these techniques. Once you start using quick change
tooling, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Once you make your
first set of soft jaws, you'll start seeing opportunities to use them
everywhere.

These aren't just "nice to have" skills - they're what will let you
take on more complex projects without losing your mind (or your
companies profit margins).
