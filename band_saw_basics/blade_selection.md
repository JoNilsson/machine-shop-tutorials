# Blade Selection

The difference between a clean cut and fighting the saw for 20 minutes. Choose wrong and you'll burn through blades and your reputation.

## TPI - Teeth Per Inch

The most important number on the blade.

### The Basic Rule

**Three teeth in the cut** - minimum:

- Too few teeth = grabbing, breaking
- Too many = clogging, burning
- Just right = smooth cutting

### TPI Selection Guide

| Material Thickness | TPI Range | Best For          |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| Under 1/4"         | 18-24     | Sheet, thin wall  |
| 1/4" - 1"          | 10-14     | Most common range |
| 1" - 3"            | 6-10      | Solid stock       |
| Over 3"            | 4-6       | Heavy sections    |

### Material-Specific TPI

**Aluminum**:

- Use coarser than steel
- Chips need room
- 6-10 for most work
- Skip tooth helps

**Steel**:

- Standard recommendations
- 10-14 most common
- Variable pitch reduces harmonics

**Stainless**:

- Finer teeth better
- 14-18 typical
- Positive rake important
- Keep cutting pressure constant

**Tubing**:

- Based on wall thickness
- Not overall diameter
- 14-24 for thin wall
- Variable pitch best

## Blade Materials

### Carbon Steel - The Cheap Option

**Good for**:

- Occasional use
- Soft materials
- Wood (if desperate)
- Learning/practice

**Bad for**:

- Production work
- Hard materials
- Any serious shop
- Your sanity

### Bi-Metal - The Standard

**What it is**:

- High-speed steel teeth
- Spring steel back
- Best of both worlds
- 90% of shop blades

**Why it works**:

- Teeth stay sharp
- Back stays flexible
- Resists breaking
- Good blade life

**Use for**:

- All general cutting
- Mixed materials
- Production work
- Daily use

### Carbide - The Premium Option

**When you need it**:

- Hardened materials
- Exotic alloys
- Maximum blade life
- Tight tolerances

**When to skip it**:

- General shop work
- Cost matters
- Interrupted cuts
- You're still learning

## Tooth Patterns

### Regular/Raker

**Pattern**: Same size teeth, one raker

```
|1|2|3|R|1|2|3|R|
```

**Good for**:

- General purpose
- Consistent materials
- Most common

### Skip Tooth

**Pattern**: Every other tooth missing

```
|1|_|3|_|5|_|
```

**Good for**:

- Soft materials
- Aluminum
- Plastics
- Better chip clearing

### Variable Pitch

**Pattern**: Varying tooth spacing

```
|1|2||3|||4|5||
```

**Best for**:

- Reducing vibration
- Mixed thicknesses
- Smoother cut
- Less noise

## Blade Width

### For Horizontal Saws

Usually fixed by machine:

- 1" x 0.035" common
- 1.25" for larger saws
- Don't modify!

### For Vertical Saws

Width determines turning radius:

| Blade Width | Minimum Radius |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 1/8"        | 1/8"           |
| 1/4"        | 5/8"           |
| 3/8"        | 1-1/2"         |
| 1/2"        | 2-1/2"         |
| 3/4"        | 5-1/2"         |

**Choose based on**:

- Tightest curve needed
- Material thickness
- Desired accuracy
- Blade life

## Set Patterns

How teeth are bent alternately.

### Standard Set

Teeth alternate left/right:

- Most common
- General purpose
- Good chip clearing

### Wavy Set

Groups of teeth wave:

- Thin materials
- Varied thickness
- Smoother cut
- Less grabbing

### Straight Set (Raker)

Some teeth straight:

- Aggressive cut
- Thicker materials
- Faster cutting
- Rougher finish

## Common Blade Problems

### Premature Dulling

**Causes**:

- Speed too high
- No coolant
- Wrong TPI
- Cheap blades

**Fix**:

- Check speed chart
- Use coolant
- Right blade selection
- Buy quality

### Blade Breaking

**Causes**:

- Tension wrong
- Guides misaligned
- Forcing curves
- Material movement

**Fix**:

- Proper tension
- Align guides
- Let saw cut
- Secure work

### Crooked Cuts

**Causes**:

- Dull blade
- Uneven set
- Guide problems
- Feed pressure

**Fix**:

- Replace blade
- Check guides
- Even pressure
- Don't force

### Stripped Teeth

**Causes**:

- Too few teeth engaged
- Material too hard
- Hit hard spot
- No break-in

**Fix**:

- Right TPI
- Slower speed
- Check material
- Break in new blades

## Blade Care

### New Blade Break-In

Critical for blade life:

1. **Reduce speed 20%**
2. **Light feed pressure**
3. **First 10 cuts**
4. **Full coolant flow**
5. **Gradually increase**

Skip this = short blade life

### Storage

**Do**:

- Coil properly (3 loops)
- Oil lightly
- Hang on pegs
- Label clearly
- Keep dry

**Don't**:

- Kink or twist
- Store loose
- Mix different types
- Leave on machine
- Let rust

### When to Replace

**Visual inspection**:

- Missing teeth
- Cracks in gullet
- Heavy wear
- Won't stay sharp

**Performance**:

- Cutting time doubles
- Can't cut straight
- Excessive heat
- Poor finish

## Blade Selection Chart

Quick reference for common jobs:

| Material     | Thickness | TPI   | Type     | Speed  |
| ------------ | --------- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| Aluminum bar | 2"        | 6-8   | Bi-metal | High   |
| Steel tube   | 1/4" wall | 14    | Variable | Medium |
| Stainless    | 1"        | 10-14 | Bi-metal | Low    |
| Brass        | Any       | 8-14  | Regular  | High   |
| Plastic      | 1/2"      | 10    | Skip     | High   |

## Cost vs Value

### Cheap Blades

**True cost**:

- Replace 5x more often
- More machine downtime
- Frustrated operators
- Poor cut quality
- Material waste

### Quality Blades

**Investment return**:

- Last 3-5x longer
- Better cuts
- Less rework
- Happy operators
- Consistent results

**Do the math**: $30 blade lasting a month beats $10 blade lasting 3 days.

## Blade Brands That Don't Suck

Without getting into religious wars:

- Lenox
- Starrett
- Simonds
- DoAll
- Amada

**Avoid**:

- No-name imports
- "Bargain" multipacks
- Used blades (really?)
- Mystery metal

## The Bottom Line

Right blade selection:

1. Count teeth in cut (3 minimum)
2. Match speed to material
3. Use appropriate tooth pattern
4. Buy quality bi-metal minimum
5. Break in properly
6. Replace when dull

Remember: The most expensive blade is the one that doesn't cut. Buy quality, set it up right, maintain it properly. Your saw (and sanity) will thank you.
