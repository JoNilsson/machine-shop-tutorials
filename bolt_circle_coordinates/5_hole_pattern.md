# Pentagon (5-Hole) Bolt Circle Pattern

## The Oddball

The 5-hole pattern is the weirdo. No nice round numbers here, no simple fractions.
With 4, 6, or 8 holes, you get nice angles that play well with shop math. But 5 holes?  
That's 72¬∞ spacing (360¬∞ √∑ 5 = 72¬∞), and 72¬∞ doesn't give you any of those _clean_ ratios.

## Understanding The Problem

For a 5-hole pattern, you're going to need:

- **Sin(72¬∞) = 0.9511**
- **Cos(72¬∞) = 0.3090**
- **Sin(36¬∞) = 0.5878**
- **Cos(36¬∞) = 0.8090**

Sorry, I don't have any mnemonic tricks to help you remember this one.  
Not exactly numbers you'll memorize like 0.7071 or 0.86603. Just bookmark this tutorial.

## Practical Method

There is a practical method though. So here's how I do it without b0rking my brains.

### Step 1: First Hole on the X-axis

Start simple. Put your first hole on the positive X-axis:

- **Hole 1**: X = +R, Y = 0

### Step 2: Calculate the Other Four

For a radius R, here are your coordinates:

1. **Hole 1**: X = +R, Y = 0 (0¬∞)
2. **Hole 2**: X = +R √ó 0.3090, Y = +R √ó 0.9511 (72¬∞)
3. **Hole 3**: X = -R √ó 0.8090, Y = +R √ó 0.5878 (144¬∞)
4. **Hole 4**: X = -R √ó 0.8090, Y = -R √ó 0.5878 (216¬∞)
5. **Hole 5**: X = +R √ó 0.3090, Y = -R √ó 0.9511 (288¬∞)

### Example: 100mm Bolt Circle

For a 100mm diameter bolt circle (50mm radius):

1. **Hole 1**: X = +50.00, Y = 0
2. **Hole 2**: X = +15.45, Y = +47.55
3. **Hole 3**: X = -40.45, Y = +29.39
4. **Hole 4**: X = -40.45, Y = -29.39
5. **Hole 5**: X = +15.45, Y = -47.55

## Shortcuts Are Nice

### Method 1: The Template

Once you calculate one 5-hole pattern, make a template. Drill it in aluminum plate and keep it on your pegboard. Future you will thank present you.

### Method 2: CAD Cop-Out

It's 2025 and we all have pocket sized supercomputers. Fire up a CAD app, draw your bolt circle, array 5 holes, read the coordinates. No shame in using technology.

### Method 3: Grandpa's Sine Bar

_Some dead guys sine bar, probably._

If you have inherited a sine bar and you're feeling saucy:

1. Set sine bar to 72¬∞
2. Drill first hole
3. Rotate part and sine bar together
4. Repeat 4 more times

## Quick Reference Table

| Bolt Circle | Radius | Hole 1    | Hole 2         | Hole 3          | Hole 4           | Hole 5          |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 80mm        | 40mm   | (40, 0)   | (12.36, 38.04) | (-32.36, 23.51) | (-32.36, -23.51) | (12.36, -38.04) |
| 100mm       | 50mm   | (50, 0)   | (15.45, 47.55) | (-40.45, 29.39) | (-40.45, -29.39) | (15.45, -47.55) |
| 127mm (5")  | 63.5mm | (63.5, 0) | (19.62, 60.39) | (-51.37, 37.32) | (-51.37, -37.32) | (19.62, -60.39) |

## The Constants

Instead of memorizing sines and cosines, just remember these multipliers for your radius:

- **Position 1**: X = R √ó 1.0000, Y = 0
- **Position 2**: X = R √ó 0.3090, Y = R √ó 0.9511
- **Position 3**: X = R √ó -0.8090, Y = R √ó 0.5878
- **Position 4**: X = R √ó -0.8090, Y = R √ó -0.5878
- **Position 5**: X = R √ó 0.3090, Y = R √ó -0.9511

Some old guys have these on a card taped to the mill. It works ‚îê( Õ°¬∞  ñÃØ Õ°¬∞)‚îå

## Verification

The distance between adjacent holes should be:

- **Chord length** = R √ó 1.1756

This is harder to measure than diameter, but it's what you've got.

## Real Talk

5-hole patterns are rare for a reason. They're a pain in the ass. If you're designing something and thinking "hmm, 5 bolts would be perfect here" - stop. Use 4. Use 6.
Your machinist might even buy you a beer. üçª

But when you absolutely must do a 5-hole pattern (yeah, I'm looking at you low-rider wheel adapter dudes), now you know how. Just don't expect it to be fun.

## Pro Tip

If you find yourself doing a lot of 5-hole patterns, invest in a rotary table or a dividing head. Set it to 72¬∞ increments and save your sanity.  
The math works, and it's a cool flex, but a rotary table works better.
