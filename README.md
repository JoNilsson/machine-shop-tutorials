- **Work Holding Secrets**: How to keep parts from becoming projectiles
- **Edge Finding Techniques**: Paper method, mechanical finders, electronic finders, finding hole centers
- **Dial Indicator Mastery**: Reading runout, tramming mills, centering in 4-jaw chucks
- **Why it matters**: You can't make accurate parts without these basics

### 2. [Drill Press Mastery](./drill_press_mastery/README.md)

How to drill holes that are actually round, in the right place, and don't turn your workpiece into a spinning weapon.

- **Drill Bit Selection**: Understanding twist drills, point angles, and materials
- **Layout and Marking**: Getting your holes in the right place every time

- **Speeds and Feeds**: Simple rules that actually work
- **Drilling Techniques**: Making clean holes and reading your chips

### 3. [Bolt Circle Coordinate Calculations](./bolt_circle_coordinates/README.md)

Complete guide to calculating hole positions for common bolt patterns. Covers 4, 5, 6, and 8-hole patterns with practical examples and some visual diagrams.

- **4 & 8-Hole Patterns**: Simple 90° and 45° spacing - the easy ones
- **5-Hole Pattern**: The oddball 72° spacing with all the weird trig values
- **6-Hole Pattern**: The most common, using 30-60-90 triangles and simple multipliers
- **Includes**: Step-by-step calculations, visual diagrams, quick reference tables, verification methods

### 4. [Compound Angles](./compound_angles/README.md)

Shop hacks for setting up angled holes and bevels when the print calls for angles in two directions. No 5-axis machine? No problem.

- **Tilt and Rotate Method**: For mills with tilting heads
- **Triangle Block Method**: Make permanent setup blocks for repeat jobs

### 6. [Shop Efficiency](./shop_efficiency/README.md)

Advanced techniques that separate hobbyists from production professionals. Save time, increase ROI.

- **Quick Change Tooling**: Stop wasting 20 minutes on tool changes
- **Soft Jaws**: Custom workholding that protects parts and speeds production
- **Shop-Made Tools**: Build your own cutting tools for special use cases & save $$$
- **Why it matters**: The difference between 4 hours and .5 hour per part

### 7. [Measurement and Quality](./measurement_quality/README.md)
